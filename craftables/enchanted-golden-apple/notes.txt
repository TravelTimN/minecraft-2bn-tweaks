1.21.9 [03 SEP 2025]:
  Pack: 88
  "The Copper Age": Reformatting of `pack.mcmeta` file. (https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack.mcmeta)

  pack.mcmeta:
  - The supported_formats field has been removed.
      - If the pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required.
      - Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed.
  - The pack_format field is now optional.
      - If the pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required.
  - Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported.
      - A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1]
      - Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0].
      - Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone.
  - Added required field max_format - specified the maximum version supported.
      - A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g [74, 1]
      - Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff.
      - Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone.
  - For overlay entries:
      - The formats field has been removed.
          - If the pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions.
          - Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed.
      - Added required field min_format and max_format with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the pack section.
